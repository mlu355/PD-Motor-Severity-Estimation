3D input poses of four subjects with increasing PD motor severity (top) and saliency of classifier (bottom). 

## Requirements

To install requirements, run:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

with Python 3.7.

## Pose Extraction

The Stanford Medicine Gait dataset is private, but [CASIA Dataset A](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Databases.asp) of control videos is available upon [request](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Databases.asp). Any similar video dataset with human movement can be used as input instead. 

To obtain the input poses for the classifier, clone and follow the instructions in the [VIBE](https://github.com/mkocabas/VIBE) repo. The script ```extract_joints <path_to_data> <output_path>``` takes a folder of videos, runs VIBE on them, and produces outputs joints in the correct format for the classifier. The output files we use are the ```vibe_output.pkl``` files generated by VIBE. An example of a joint file generated by VIBE with an image from the corresponding video for the CASIA dataset is in ```data/sample```. The initial paper detailed a longer pose extraction sequence which has since been automated by VIBE, so the simpler version is provided. 

## Data Preprocessing

```data_preprocessing.ipynb``` provides step-by-step instructions for preprocessing joint data.

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --model_dir <params_and_output_path> --seed <random_seed>
```

or use

```train
python train.py
```

for the default mode. The <model_dir> should contain a params.json file formatted as in ```jobs/default/params.json```.
